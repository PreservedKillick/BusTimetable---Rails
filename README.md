=====================

April 7, 2014

Epicodus: Week8, Day1

first day of Ruby on Rails with 'magic methods'

***********************
Lesson

This exercise is similar to the train exercise we did previously, but we'll re-do it in Rails now. Here are some user stories to start out with:

-As a bus system operator, I want to add bus stations, so that I can show where all of the buses will go.

-As a bus system operator, I want to add bus lines, so that I can track which lines go to which stations.

-As a bus rider, I want to view a bus line, so that I can see the stations where it stops.

-As a bus rider, I want to view a bus station, so that I can see which buses come to it.

There's a many-to-many relationship between stations and lines.I'd suggest calling your join table stops.
